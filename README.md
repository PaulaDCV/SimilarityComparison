# Comparing similarity algorithms.
An investigation on the running times of similarity algorithms used in the context of document similarity. The two  algorithms investigated are Jaccard's similarity and Cosine similarity. An individual look at each algorithm is done, in the case of cosine, with some variations as well as a general comparison of both algorithms. <br/>
The first part looks at Jaccards algorithm applied to documents with different lengths represented as bag of words.
The second part uses Cosine similarity and documents represented as vectors. There is also a look into wether a custom function for calculating the dot product or using numpys dot product function makes a diference. <br/>
The third part focuses on cosine similarity of different document lengths, but this time using a bag of words representation. <br/>
The forth part investigates the runtime and complexity for different algorithms when calculating the similarity between each document pair in a collection. A comparison of each alforithm is done.
